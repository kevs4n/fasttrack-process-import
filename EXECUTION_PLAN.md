- ✅ Full backend API capabilities now accessible to end users
- ✅ Professional user experience with visual feedback and validation

**Next Phase**: Frontend testing validation and Azure DevOps integration completion

5. **Function Namespace Translation** 🚨 → ⚡ IN PROGRESS  
   - **ISSUE**: Direct function calls vs namespaced calls causing backend compatibility issues
   - **IMPACT**: Original functionality expects specific function names and element IDs
   - **FIXING**: Systematically updating HTML to match original semantic structure

#### Current Restoration Status:
- ✅ **Tree View**: Fully restored with all interactive controls
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Element IDs and handlers corrected  
- ⚡ **GitHub Tab**: Structure restored, functionality needs JavaScript updates
- ⚠️ **Models Preview**: Identified for future implementation
- 🔄 **Cross-Module**: Semantic compatibility ongoing

### 📊 COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW COMPLETED ✅

#### Critical Issues Found & Resolved:
1. **Tab Navigation Bug** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Button selector in `showTab()` looked for `onclick*="'${tabName}')"]` 
   - **Problem**: Current modular HTML uses `onclick="UIUtils.showTab('${tabName}')"`
   - **Fix**: Updated selector to match exact UIUtils namespace calls
   - **Impact**: Tab active states now work correctly

2. **Missing Azure DevOps Functions** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Original `checkAzureStatus()` and `updateStatus()` functions missing
   - **Problem**: Called during initialization but didn't exist in modular version
   - **Fix**: Added both methods to AzureDevOpsManager class
   - **Impact**: Azure DevOps status checking now functional

3. **Manager Namespace Mismatches** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: UI Utils referenced `window.AzureDevOps` instead of `window.AzureDevOpsManager`
   - **Issue**: UI Utils referenced `window.TreeView` instead of `window.TreeViewManager`
   - **Fix**: Corrected all namespace references to match actual exposed objects
   - **Impact**: Cross-module communication now works properly

4. **JavaScript Syntax Errors** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Orphaned code block in azure-devops.js causing compilation errors
   - **Fix**: Removed malformed template literal and fixed method structure
   - **Impact**: All JavaScript files now compile without errors

#### Non-Critical Feature Gaps Identified:
1. **GitHub File Selection** ⚠️ (Future Enhancement)
   - **Missing**: Bulk file selection with checkboxes
   - **Missing**: "Select All" / "Clear All" functionality  
   - **Missing**: "Process Selected Files" batch operation
   - **Current State**: Repository files load automatically when repo selected
   - **Priority**: Low - current functionality works, just different UX approach

#### Architecture Validation Results:
- ✅ **All 6 JavaScript modules**: Error-free and properly structured
- ✅ **Namespace exposure**: All managers correctly available on window object
- ✅ **Cross-module dependencies**: Properly implemented through window references
- ✅ **Initialization sequence**: Enhanced with all necessary startup calls
- ✅ **CSS modularization**: Successfully extracted to main.css
- ✅ **HTML structure**: Clean 309-line modular architecture

### 📝 DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES & CONTINUATION PROMPTS

#### Continuation Prompt Strategy for Large Architectural Changes
When working on complex multi-phase implementations that approach token limits, use comprehensive continuation prompts that include:

1. **Conversation Overview**: Primary objectives, session context, and user intent evolution
2. **Technical Foundation**: Architecture details, current codebase status, and dependencies  
3. **Problem Resolution**: Issues encountered, solutions implemented, and lessons learned
4. **Progress Tracking**: Completed tasks, partially complete work, and validated outcomes
5. **Active Work State**: Current focus, recent context, working code, and immediate context
6. **Recent Operations**: Last commands executed, tool results summary, and operation context
7. **Continuation Plan**: Pending tasks, next actions, and specific implementation steps

#### Key Principles for Modular Architecture Refactoring:
- **Systematic Analysis**: Identify monolithic components and their pain points
- **Professional Separation**: Create focused modules with single responsibilities  
- **Incremental Implementation**: Break large refactoring into manageable phases
- **Docker Integration**: Rebuild and test after architectural changes
- **Context Preservation**: Use detailed continuation prompts to maintain development flow
- **Validation Testing**: Verify functionality after each major structural change

#### Token Management Best Practices:
- **Proactive Planning**: Monitor conversation length and prepare continuation prompts
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: Include all essential context in continuation prompts
- **Command History**: Document recent operations and their outcomes
- **Technical State**: Capture current architecture, file structure, and deployment status
- **Next Steps**: Clearly define immediate actions and pending tasks
