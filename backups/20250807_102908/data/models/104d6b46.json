          "Description": "<span>Concept to market is the process of managing a service offering from its inception to its eventual end of life. The process typically begins with the development of a service offering idea, which is then refined and tested to ensure that it meets customer needs. After the service is launched, it's important to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to keep it competitive in the marketplace. As the service offering matures, it might be necessary to update or refresh the design to maintain customer interest. Eventually, the service offering might reach the end of its marketable life and be retired from the market. Throughout the concept to market process, careful attention must be paid to customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements to ensure that the service offering remains relevant and successful.<br></span><div><br> </div><div>In service-based organizations or organizations that sell services alongside tangible products, Dynamics 365 offers a variety of products to help support the design and development of new service offerings and control the downstream transactions that occur in the organization. For example, when you use Dynamics 365 Field Service, you can define service offerings that are sold by using Dynamics 365 Sales or Supply Chain Management. For complex services, such as professional services, you can define the services in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or Sales, and use Dynamics 365 Project Operations to help manage the lifecycle of your customer relationship. Additionally, you can mix and match services with tangible products on orders, include services in your production process, or outsource services by using Procurement and sourcing, Project Operations, or Field Service, to give just a few examples.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>Important:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:inherit;\">The process that is defined here doesn't include the process for designing tangible products. Learn more at Design to retire introduction.</span> </div><div><br> </div><span>Every organization has variations of the concept to market process. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization that is looking to implement a technology solution to support the concept to market process for services.</span>",

          "Description": "<span>The ability for an organization to create new services in their offerings plays a pivotal role in the growth and innovation of the organization. The business process area involves strategic development, launch, and integration of fresh offerings into the market, ensuring that the organization remains competitive and responsive to the evolving needs of customers. The process of introducing new offerings into the market can vary drastically from industry to industry and geography to geography, among other factors. However, one certainty among all organizations is that the process can be costly, time consuming, and has a direct impact on the organization's bottom line. For this reason, having strong technology solutions such as Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Power Platform are essential to ensure that business decision makers have the right information to make the right decisions.<br></span><div><br> </div><div>Organizations can diversify their portfolio, tap into new revenue streams, and strengthen market presence by introducing new services. The Dynamics 365 product suite offers various tools and products to help support this process across several industries. Here are some examples:<br> </div><div><ul><li>Dynamics 365 Field Service offers capabilities to offer many types of services to organizations. </li><li>Dynamics 365 Customer Service offers capabilities to support services that are offered to customers. </li><li>Dynamics 365 Commerce offers capabilities to track sales and services in the point of sale, online, in a call center, or with integrations from Dynamics 365 Sales or other solutions that help you manage your sales cycle. </li><li>Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports the lifecycle of services. </li> </ul> </div><div>With complex support for different types of services across the portfolio, it's important to select the right technologies to support your business needs.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>When introducing new services, it's important to consider that careful execution of the market research, ideation, rigorous testing, and seamless coordination across departments is executed well. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys offers tools to help with many steps. When you use Customer Insights with productivity tools such as Microsoft Teams, Planner, and Outlook, and Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, for example, the organization can successfully implement solutions to support the process leading to increased customer satisfaction, increased brand reputation, and sustainable growth.<br> </div><div><br> </div><span>When organizations are looking to implement technological solutions to support the introduction of new service business processes, we recommend that these activities are prioritized and planned early in the process. The service data that is captured as part of the business process is critical to many of the downstream processes. A poor implementation might cause data quality issues that can lead to other issues later in the project and in the overall business cycle. Keep in mind that service data is considered master data and should be carefully planned and integrated into all downstream business processes. If you're planning to use a non-Microsoft solution for service master data, you can integrate your solution in the first phases of your service and you can look to replace the non-Microsoft solution in a later phase. However, careful considerations for the functionality needed should be taken early in the project to avoid reworking later.</span>",

In the realm of Dynamics 365, the interconnected suite of products (including Dynamics 365 Sales, Field Service, Project Operations, and Supply Chain Management) provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing service pricing strategies. These tools synergistically contribute to the holistic management of service pricing, addressing various facets of the business processes involved.<br></span><div><br> </div><div>The management of service pricing encompasses a series of essential business processes. First, organizations need to meticulously determine service prices and eligibility for discounts, tailoring their offerings to market demands and competitive landscapes. Simultaneously, the creation and maintenance of service fees become paramount, requiring a fine-tuned approach to align pricing structures with value propositions.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>Service pricing agreements further solidify the foundation, fostering transparent and mutually beneficial relationships between service providers and clients. In addition, the dynamic market demands necessitate the agile creation and maintenance of service promotional pricing and discounts, ensuring adaptability to changing landscapes.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>Regular reviews of service pricing and discount agreements become a cornerstone in the lifecycle of the services you offer and purchase, allowing organizations to refine their strategies and stay ahead in the ever-evolving business landscape. This holistic approach to service pricing within Dynamics 365 not only streamlines processes but also empowers organizations to navigate the complexities of the market with agility and foresight.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>In a service-based organization, where you'll be using any of the downstream processes in the Dynamics 365 implementation such as procure to pay, prospect to quote, order to cash, plan to produce, project to profit, case to resolution, service to cash, or record to report, it's essential to ensure that the business processes related to managing the pricing of those services are considered early in the project.<br> </div><div><br> </div><span>The data and output of these business processes affect many other downstream processes and ensuring these are defined early in the project ensures project success. If Dynamics 365 won't be used to master the service data, integrations to the system of record should be considered early.</span>",

The goal is to know the amount of money that goes into staffing or outsourcing a particular service and delivering it to the customer. This information is crucial for setting prices, making informed decisions about resource allocation, and evaluating the financial performance of the business.<br></span><div><br> </div><div>Here are some of the key reasons why the definition of service costs is important:<br> </div><div><ul><li><b>Pricing:</b> An understanding of the costs of delivering a service helps organizations set prices that are appropriate and profitable. If the costs aren't understood, it can be difficult to determine a fair price that covers expenses and generates a profit. </li><li><b>Profitability: </b>By calculating the costs that are associated with delivering services, organizations can determine whether they are making a profit. This information is crucial for assessing the financial health of the business and identifying areas for improvement. </li><li><b>Resource allocation:</b> An understanding of the costs of delivering or outsourcing services helps organizations more effectively allocate their resources. By understanding the costs that are involved, businesses can make decisions about how to allocate resources such as labor, materials, and equipment. </li><li><b>Cost reduction:</b> An understanding of the costs of delivering or outsourcing services can help organizations identify areas where costs can be reduced. If expenses can be reduced in any areas without compromising quality, businesses can become more efficient and improve their bottom line. </li> </ul> </div><div>Overall, the definition of service costs is essential for any organization that wants to operate efficiently, remain competitive, and generate a healthy profit. By having a clear understanding of costs, businesses can make informed decisions about pricing, resource allocation, and cost reduction. Therefore, they can ultimately achieve greater success and profitability.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>Microsoft business applications include tools to help support organizations as they define service costs to track, report, and analyze profitability, margins, and more. Here are just a few examples that show how Dynamics 365 can support your costing business requirements:<br> </div><div><ul><li>Dynamics 365 Sales and Field Service include a product catalog feature that helps you quickly define the cost that is tracked on each transaction. </li><li><span>Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management supports the calculation of indirect costs (sometimes referred to as overhead costs) for purchased or produced items. It also supports a costing sheet that you can use to analyze the breakdown of costs.</span> </li> </ul> </div>",

      "description": "<span>Concept to market is the process of managing a service offering from its inception to its eventual end of life. The process typically begins with the development of a service offering idea, which is then refined and tested to ensure that it meets customer needs. After the service is launched, it's important to monitor its performance and make necessary adjustments to keep it competitive in the marketplace. As the service offering matures, it might be necessary to update or refresh the design to maintain customer interest. Eventually, the service offering might reach the end of its marketable life and be retired from the market. Throughout the concept to market process, careful attention must be paid to customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements to ensure that the service offering remains relevant and successful.<br></span><div><br> </div><div>In service-based organizations or organizations that sell services alongside tangible products, Dynamics 365 offers a variety of products to help support the design and development of new service offerings and control the downstream transactions that occur in the organization. For example, when you use Dynamics 365 Field Service, you can define service offerings that are sold by using Dynamics 365 Sales or Supply Chain Management. For complex services, such as professional services, you can define the services in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management or Sales, and use Dynamics 365 Project Operations to help manage the lifecycle of your customer relationship. Additionally, you can mix and match services with tangible products on orders, include services in your production process, or outsource services by using Procurement and sourcing, Project Operations, or Field Service, to give just a few examples.<br> </div><div><br> </div><div>Important:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight:inherit;\">The process that is defined here doesn't include the process for designing tangible products. Learn more at Design to retire introduction.</span> </div><div><br> </div><span>Every organization has variations of the concept to market process. Here, we define the basic outline for any organization that is looking to implement a technology solution to support the concept to market process for services.</span>",
